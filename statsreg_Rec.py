Title: "Response surface methodology for three factors and one response"

Github: https://github.com/Marcodelflow

Description:
This scrips fit a cuadratic multilinear model in order to generate a repsonse 
surface for further optimization. The code used the experimetnal results of a 
central composite design (CCD) which data is allocated ina csv file (see
rsm_results.csv).

The code is only valid for three effects and one response. You can adapt to code 
modifiying the coeff list in main() and adding more effects """
